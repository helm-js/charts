### Bug fixes

   [weaveworks/flux#1710](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1710)

## 0.6.0 (2019-01-14)

**Note** To fix the connectivity problems between Flux and memcached we've changed the 
memcached service from headless to ClusterIP. This change will make the Helm upgrade fail 
with `ClusterIP field is immutable`. 

Before upgrading to 0.6.0 you have to delete the memcached headless service:

```bash
kubectl -n flux delete svc flux-memcached
```

### Improvements

 - Updated Flux to `1.9.0` and Helm operator to `0.5.3`
   [weaveworks/flux#1662](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1662)
 - Add resetValues field to HelmRelease CRD
   [weaveworks/flux#1628](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1628)
 - Use ClusterIP service name for connecting to memcached
   [weaveworks/flux#1618](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1618)
 - Increase comprehensiveness of values table in `chart/flux/README.md`
   [weaveworks/flux#1626](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1626)
    - Rectify error where `resources` are not `None` by default in `chart/flux/values.yaml`
    - Add more fields that are actually in `chart/flux/values.yaml`
    - Separate `replicaCount` into a flux one and `helmOperator.replicaCount` one
  - Only create the `flux-helm-tls-ca-config` file if `.Values.helmOperator.tls.caContent` exists.
    Useful when doing flux upgrades but do not happen to know or want to specify
    the `caContent` in `values.yaml`. Otherwise, the existing caContent will be overriden with an
    empty value.
    [weaveworks/flux#1649](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1649)
  - Add Flux AWS ECR flags
    [weaveworks/flux#1655](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1655)
