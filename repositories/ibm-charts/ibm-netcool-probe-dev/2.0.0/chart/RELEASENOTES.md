# Whatâ€™s new in IBM Netcool Probe for Kubernetes Chart (Limited Use) Version 2.0.0

With IBM Netcool Probe for Kubernetes Chart (Limited Use) Version 2.0.0, the following changes were included:

* New probe image version used.
  * Internal improvements in Message Bus 8.0 Webhook transport.
* Helm upgrade with a change in the probe configmap will trigger a rolling update.

## Breaking Changes

This chart version has the following changes which breaks upgrade.

* Chart code re-factorization. The `image.repository` parameter does not include the image name. New `image.name` parameter is introduced and fixed to `netcool-probe-messagebus`. The `image.repository` value is used to pull the probe image and `image.testRepository` is used to pull `busybox:1.28.4` image for helm test.
* Default probe service type is now set to `ClusterIP` from `NodePort` to conform to best practices and reduce security concerns.
* Default `netcool.primaryServer`,`netcool.primaryHost` and `netcool.primaryPort` is set to `nil`. Users will have to enter the correct values for the probe to connect successfully.

## Fixes

* Message Bus 8.0 fixes an issue when a payload larger than 1kB causes an error to be logged.

## Prerequisites
