# WebSphere Liberty Helm Chart
WebSphere Liberty is a fast, dynamic, easy-to-use Java EE application server. Ideal for developers but also ready for production, Liberty is a combination of IBM technology and open source software, with fast startup times (<2 seconds), and a simple XML configuration. All in a package that's <70 MB to download. You can be developing applications in no time. With a flexible, modular runtime, you can download additional features from the Liberty Repository or strip it back to the bare essentials for deployment into production environments. Everything in Liberty is designed to help you get your job done how you want to do it.

## Requirements

A persistent volume is required, if you plan on using the transaction service within Liberty. The server.xml Liberty configuration file must be configured to place the transaction log on this volume so that it persists, if the server fails and restarts.


## Accessing Liberty

From a browser, use http://*external ip*:*nodeport* to access the application.

## Configuration

### Parameters

The Helm chart has the following values that can be overriden using the --set parameter. For example:

*    `helm repo add ibm-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/stable/`
*    `helm install --name liberty2 --set resources.constraints.enabled=true --set autoscaling.enabled=true --set autoscaling.minReplicas=2 ibm-charts/ibm-websphere-liberty --debug`

##### Configuring Liberty within IBM Cloud Private

###### Liberty docker image helm chart requirements

The helm chart requires the docker image have certain directories linked. The websphere-liberty image from docker hub will already have the expected links. If you are not using this image, you must add the following to your Dockerfile:
```
ENV LOG_DIR /logs
ENV WLP_OUTPUT_DIR /opt/ibm/wlp/output
RUN mkdir /logs \
    && ln -s $WLP_OUTPUT_DIR/defaultServer /output \
    && ln -s /opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer /config
```


###### Transaction log
If the server fails and restarts, then to persist the transaction logs (preserve them through server restarts) you must set logs.persistTransactionLogs to true and configure persistence in the helm chart. You must also add the following to your server.xml in your docker image.

```
<transaction
    recoverOnStartup="true"
    waitForRecovery="true" />
```

For more information about the transaction element and its attributes, see [transaction - Transaction Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.liberty.autogen.nd.doc/ae/rwlp_config_transaction.html) in the Liberty documentation.

###### Persisting logs

Create a persistent volume (PV) in a shared storage, NFS for example, with the following specification:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: <persistent volume name>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: <optional - must match PVC>
  nfs:
    server: <NFS Server IP>
    path: <NFS PATH>
```
Note: For NFS PATH you need to create your directory manually before deploying the persistent volume.

You can create a PV using the above template by executing:

kubectl create -f <yaml-file>

You can also create a PV from IBM Cloud Private UI by following these steps:

    From the Dashboard panel, click Create resource.
    Copy and paste the PV template.
    Click Create.

###### SSL Configuration
SSL is enabled by default. Only the secure port (9443) is exposed. Therefore, all applications must be accessed via HTTPS. It is highly recommended to set createClusterSSLConfiguration and useClusterSSLConfiguration to true to establish trust between applications. 

The helm chart by default requires the Liberty docker image to have the ssl-1.0 feature installed (default websphere-liberty image includes ssl-1.0). 

To turn off SSL:
1. Change service.port and service.targetPort to the nonsecure port. (default is 9080)
2. Set ssl.enabled to false.
3. If using ingress, set ingress.secureBackends to false.
