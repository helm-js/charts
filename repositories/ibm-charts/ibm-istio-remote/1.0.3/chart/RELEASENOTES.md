# What's new in Chart Version 1.0.3

Weâ€™re proud to release Istio 1.0! Istio has been in development for nearly two years, and the 1.0 release represents a substantial milestone for us. All of our [core features](https://istio.io/about/feature-stages/) are now ready for production use.

Istio 1.0 only has a few new features relative to 0.8 as most of the effort for this release went into fixing bugs and improving performance.

# Fixes

- Add support for ppc64le architecture. Now you can run Istio control plane and data plane on nodes with power platform.

- Update `kubectl` version from `v1.10.0` to `v1.11.1`

# Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.9 or newer with [RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) enabled
  If you wish to enable [automatic sidecar injection](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection), you must use Kubernetes version 1.9 or greater and the kube-apiserver process has the `admission-control` flag set with the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` and `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controllers added and listed in the correct order and the admissionregistration API is enabled.
  ```
  $ kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration
  admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1
  admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
  ```
