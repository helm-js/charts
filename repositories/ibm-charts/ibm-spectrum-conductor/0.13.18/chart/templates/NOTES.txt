1. Configure your client DNS server to resolve "{{ template "master-fullname" . }}" to any public IP of the Kubernetes cluster. You can configure the host mapping in the client host /etc/hosts for a UNIX OS or /etc/hosts counterpart for Windows OS. For instance, replacing the "x.x.x.x" with any public ip of the Kubernetes cluster.
$ cat /etc/hosts
x.x.x.x {{ template "master-fullname" . }}

2. Access the cluster by browser with url "https://{{ template "master-fullname" . }}:{{ template "guiPort" . }}/platform"

3. When the browser prompts you about an untrusted connection, accept the exception. You also need to open the following to pages to accept the exceptions as well:  "https://{{ template "master-fullname" . }}:{{ template "ascdPort" . }}/platform" and "https://{{ template "master-fullname" . }}:{{ template "egoRestPort" . }}/platform"

Check up "User this proxy server for all protocols".

2. Access the cluster by browser with url "https://{{ template "master-fullname" . }}:8443/platform"
